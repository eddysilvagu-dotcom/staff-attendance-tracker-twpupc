Each staff member's row should show their name and attendance for each day of the week.\n3.  **Implement Add Staff Functionality:** Add a button to `index.tsx` that opens a modal or new screen to add a new staff member.\n4.  **Implement Attendance Toggling:** Make each day of the week in a staff member's row tappable. Tapping a day should toggle the attendance status (present/absent) for that day and update the stored data.\n5.  **Implement Remove Staff Functionality:** Add a button or swipe action to each staff member's row to allow removing the staff member.\n6.  **Implement Update Attendance Functionality:** Allow the user to tap on a staff member to view and edit their attendance records in more detail.\n7.  **Modify Components:** Modify `components/Button.tsx` and `components/BottomSheet.tsx` to fit the new design.\n8.  **Error Handling:** Implement error handling using `utils/errorLogger.ts`.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-25T17:56:52.148742"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a staff attendance app!
